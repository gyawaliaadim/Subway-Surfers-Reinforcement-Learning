"""
Interactive ROI (Region of Interest) selector for defining the game capture area.

Loads a reference image and allows the user to manually draw a bounding box
over the Subway Surfers gameplay region using OpenCV's GUI selection tool.
The selected coordinates (top, left, width, height) are then formatted into
a `game_region` dictionary compatible with MSS-based screen capture scripts.

This is used to precisely calibrate the area of the screen that should be
captured for dataset collection or real-time AI inference.
